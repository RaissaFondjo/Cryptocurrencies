# Cryptocurrencies
## Project Overview

Our client would like to offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers so we are asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. We will use unsupervised learning to process the data and then pass it to machine learning models. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decide on a clustering algorithm.

## Tasks

* Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
